# LiteRT Tensor

**A lightweight, Tensor centric C++ library for high-performance tensor
manipulation on mobile devices.**

LiteRT Tensor provides an expressive and intuitive API for developers working
with the LiteRT framework, simplifying complex pre- and post-processing of
tensor data.

## Key Features

* **High-Level API:** A familiar, Tensor centric syntax for tensor operations.
* **Performance-Focused:** Optimized for mobile with a focus on zero-copy
operations to avoid unnecessary data duplication.
* **Seamless LiteRT Integration:** Designed to work directly with LiteRT's
`TensorBuffer` for a smooth developer experience.
* **Lightweight:** a small binary footprint and minimal dependencies.
